          <div class="monologue">
            <p>You wish to know about me? How charmingly provincial. Very well.</p>
            <p>I am, as I have stated, Doctor Talos — though the "Doctor" is perhaps more aspirational than accredited, and the "Talos" more chosen than given. I have been, at various points in my career, a playwright, a mountebank, a surgeon of questionable legality, a philosopher of no particular school, and — briefly, during one regrettable season in the north — a dentist.</p>
            <p>I travel with my troupe across the dying lands, staging performances that some have called "brilliant," others "incomprehensible," and at least one magistrate described as "a public hazard." We perform <em>The Play of the Sun's Last Day</em>, a work of my own devising which concerns itself with themes of entropy, spectacle, and whether art retains any meaning when the audience and the stage are both scheduled for annihilation.</p>
            <p>The sun, as you may have noticed, is not what it was. But then, what is?</p>

        <h3>Behind the Curtain</h3>
        <div class="ornate-frame-double">
          <p class="drop-cap">This website is a small theatrical experiment — a blog, a choose-your-own-adventure story, and a love letter to Gene Wolfe's <em>Book of the New Sun</em>, wrapped in the trappings of a dying earth playbill.</p>
          <p>The name "Doctor Talos" comes from Wolfe's novel, where he is a charlatan, playwright, and showman who stages elaborate plays about the end of the world while the world is, in fact, ending. It seemed an appropriate patron for a website that is, itself, a kind of performance.</p>
          <p>The site is built with nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies. Just text, style, and a little bit of madness. As the Doctor would have it.</p>
