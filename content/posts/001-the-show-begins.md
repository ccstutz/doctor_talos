So you have found us. Whether by intention, accident, or the sort of cosmic bureaucratic error that tends to occur when a universe is winding down its operations — you are here, and here you shall remain, at least until the intermission.

I am Doctor Talos. You will have read the sign. I trust you can read? Literacy, like the sun, is not what it was, but one must maintain standards even as the standards themselves decay.

This establishment — and I use the word with full awareness of its optimism — is a place of dispatches, performances, and therapeutic exhibitions. The therapy, I should note, is primarily for myself. The exhibitions are for you. Whether they prove therapeutic for *you* as well is, frankly, none of my concern.

What you will find here, in these dispatches, is the record of a traveling show at the end of time. Observations on the nature of entropy, art, and the persistent human delusion that stories matter. They do not, of course. But we tell them anyway, because the alternative is silence, and silence — as anyone who has experienced the void between stars can attest — is deeply overrated.

I write because the sun is dying and someone should be taking notes.

I write because my troupe — loyal, bewildered, occasionally mutinous — deserves a chronicler, even an unreliable one.

I write because the alternative is practicing medicine, and my patients have, historically, not benefited from the experience.

So. Welcome to the show. Take your seat. Mind the gap between reality and performance — it is narrower than you think, and the fall, should you slip, is considerable.

The dispatches will arrive as they arrive. I make no promises regarding frequency, coherence, or truthfulness. I am, after all, a doctor of no particular accreditation and a playwright of no particular talent. But I am here, and the lights are on, and the sun — bless its exhausted, guttering heart — is still burning.

That will have to be enough.

*— Doctor Talos, writing by candlelight in the wings, while the audience files in and the sun does its weary best*
