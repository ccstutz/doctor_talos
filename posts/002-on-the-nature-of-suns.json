    "The sun, I am told by those who claim to know about such things, is a ball of burning gas. Or plasma. Or the dream of a sleeping god. The explanation varies depending on the era, the scholar, and the amount of wine consumed prior to theorizing.",
    "What is not in dispute is this: it is getting dimmer.",
    "Not quickly. Not in the manner of a candle snuffed between wet fingers. More in the manner of a long exhalation — the kind you make when you have been holding your breath for four billion years and have finally accepted that no one is coming to relieve you.",
    "I think about the sun more than is perhaps healthy. This is an occupational hazard of running a traveling show in its light; one becomes attuned to the quality of illumination the way a painter becomes attuned to the quality of pigment. And the quality, my friends, is declining.",
    "The reds are redder. The shadows are longer. Noon looks like what dusk looked like when I was young — though I confess my memory of youth is itself unreliable, being filtered through the same deteriorating lens as everything else.",
    "But here is what I find genuinely interesting, and what I wish to set down in this dispatch before the thought escapes me (thoughts, like photons, are harder to trap than you'd imagine):",
    "We <em>perform</em> differently under a dying sun.",
    "When the light was strong and white, plays were about conflict. Hero against villain, order against chaos, the bright sword of righteousness et cetera. The audience wanted resolution. They wanted the sun to win because the sun, being omnipresent and reliable, represented the natural order.",
    "But now? Now the audience wants something else. They want to be told that the dark is not so bad. That there are things worth doing even when the lights are going out. That the show — this absurd, creaking, beautiful show — matters precisely <em>because</em> it is temporary. Perhaps they want to be lied to. I am happy to oblige. I am, after all, a professional.",
    "There is a school of thought that says art only matters when times are good. That in crisis, we should concern ourselves with practical things: food, shelter, the mechanical prolonging of solar output. To which I say: nonsense. <em>Absolute</em> nonsense. The sun does not need our help to die. It is managing perfectly well on its own. What it needs — what <em>we</em> need — is someone to watch. To note the particular shade of red. To write it down. To say: <em>I was here when the light changed, and it was terrible, and it was beautiful, and I did not look away.</em>",
    "That is what this show is. That is what these dispatches are. A record of not looking away.",
    "The sun will do what it will do. I will do what I can, which is considerably less but — I flatter myself — rather more entertaining.",
    "Tomorrow we perform <em>The Play of the Sun's Last Day</em> for a new audience. I have revised the third act again. The ending is still not right. But then, the ending of a play about the end of everything can never truly be right, because the real ending has not happened yet, and when it does, there will be no one left to review it.",
    "A comforting thought, in its way. The final critic is entropy, and entropy gives everyone five stars.",
    "<em>— Doctor Talos, who has been staring at the sun again and really ought to stop</em>"
